/* Created function that declares finds smallest and largest value in the array
    then subtracts those values and returns the difference to function main */

/* Created second function that find the pair of elements with the
    smallest difference in value within the aray and subtracted them 
    from each other larger number then smaller number 
    Lastly I returned the difference to main*/

/* Created a main function that had the sole purpose of outputing
    the functions outside of main into terminal*/
 
 
 
 
// Global Variable that initializes the size of the array
